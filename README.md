## Clover Hackintosh Files

backup of my high sierra files, thou they shall not get lost

### What works

Everything except sleep.

Enable the "prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off" option.

### Specs

These Clover files work with:

```bash
* CPU              Intel 7700K
* Mainboard        Gigabytes GA-B250M-D3H
* Graphics         NVIDIA GTX 1070
* RAM              16GB DDR4
* Storage          ADATA XPG SX8200 512GB
```

NVIDIA is not supported in newer macOS releases. :(

Happy hacking!
